Cultural and historic resources include Jurell plantation, Fort Hawkins, Ocmulgee National monument, and presence of Indian mounds with an opportunity to link to boundary expansion with high potential to extend Ocmulgee National monument boundaries (current ongoing study may have authority to extend boundaries of migration corridor). Bon Swamp National Wildlife Refuge has an approved boundary of 19,000 acres without further legislation, providing high potential to link to key surrounding habitat.

This area extends from Oconee National Forest and Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge south toward Hawkinsville and linking Macon/Warner-Robbins. Cultural and historic resources include Jurell plantation, Fort Hawkins, Ocmulgee National monument, and presence of Indian mounds with an opportunity to link to boundary expansion with high potential to extend Ocmulgee National monument boundaries (current ongoing study may have authority to extend boundaries of migration corridor). Bon Swamp National Wildlife Refuge has an approved boundary of 19,000 acres without further legislation, providing high potential to link to key surrounding habitat. Middle GA bear population occupies important connecting habitat between the Ocmulgee an Oconee Rivers through Twiggs and Wilkinson counties. A smaller, isolated bear population is along river, branches eastward to Twiggs and Wilson Counties that connect Ocee Woods and Oconee River.

There is a need to identify Piedmont rocky shoals along the Fall Line, across the entire South Atlantic LCC.  Many of these rocky shoals are in need of protection, restoration, and conservation.   These important riverine habitats are critical for spawning American shad, robust redhorse, Carolina redhorse, shoals spider lily, American eels, many freshwater mussels, crayfishes, dragonflies, and other taxa.  The shoals themselves may be identified in the NWI data layers as Cowardin et al. classification as lower perennial rock bottom or unconsolidated bottom, palustrine, rock bottom, or even degraded areas of lacustrine, limnetic or littoral unconsolidated bottom.
