     "justification": "Part of the Okefenokee Osceola Eglin AFB Complex and Big Bend coastline. This is a large landscape containing longleaf pine, large swamps, and rivers (Suwanee and St. Marys).  Also this area ties the Gulf and Atlantic coasts together. There is a group of stakeholders that have done conservation planning in the OkefenokeeOsceola area and they should be consulted regarding management actions. Important area for coastal to inland migration of communities and species. A key area for management and protection in response to sea level rise and an important area for economy for inshorenear-shore harvest (clams, scallops, oysters). A rich estuarine habitat with a dependency on freshwater flows and inputs. There is connectivity from coastal waters to inland freshwater and many threatenedendangered species. Concentration of working forests and fisheries.",
