        "Part of the Okefenokee/Osceola/Eglin AFB Complex and Big Bend coastline. This is a large landscape containing longleaf pine, large swamps, and rivers (Suwanee and St. Marys).  Also this area ties the Gulf and Atlantic coasts together. There is a group of stakeholders that have done conservation planning in the Okefenokee/Osceola area and they should be consulted regarding management actions. Important area for coastal to inland migration of communities and species. A key area for management and protection in response to sea level rise and an important area for economy for inshore/near-shore harvest (clams, scallops, oysters). A rich estuarine habitat with a dependency on freshwater flows and inputs. There is connectivity from coastal waters to inland freshwater and many threatened/endangered species. Concentration of working forests and fisheries.",
